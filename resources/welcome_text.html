<p><strong>Welcome to the Evolution Simulator</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This tool allows you to simulate the natural process of evolution based on a very simple ecosystem. Essentially, the tool simulates an environment filled with mice and owls. The mice strive to survive by eating grass, while the owls prey on the mice. Both animals are capable of propagating and pass down their genes to the offspring. Let evolution do its work, and see the marvelous effects of natural selection!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are 2 modes available in this tool, which you can select by the buttons below.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>1. Start the interactive evolution simulator, allowing you to see evolution working.</li>
<li>2. Start the automatic test, which automatically tests your custom configuration, and determines the optimal variables for evolution.</li>
</ul>
