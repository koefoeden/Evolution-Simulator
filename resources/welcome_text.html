<h2><strong>Welcome to the Evolution Simulator!</strong></h2>
<p>This tool allows you to simulate the natural process of evolution based on a very simple ecosystem. Essentially, the tool simulates an environment filled with mice and owls. The mice strive to survive by eating grass, while the owls prey on the mice. Both animals are capable of propagating and pass down their genes to the offspring. Let evolution do its work, and see the marvelous effects of natural selection!</p>
<p>Every simulation is based on a number of settings that you will specify before beforehand - or you can choose a pre-determined configuration if you like!</p>
<p>Now, you can choose between to options by clickng the appropriate button below:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>
<p>1. Start the interactive evolution simulator, allowing you to see evolution working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2. Start the automatic test, which automatically tests your custom configuration, and determines the optimal variables for evolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>
